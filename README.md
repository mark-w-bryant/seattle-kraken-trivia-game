# seattle-kraken-trivia-game
A game to test your knowledge of Seattle Kraken Hockey history. This was my first attempt at utilizing jQuery in a project.
# Future tasks
- It was coded to be flexible so that game will handle additional questions once added to the JSON file.
- Randomize the questions so there is greater replay value.
- Timing of events can be smoother once I have additional experience
- I gathered links to videos corresponding to each question and included in the JSON file. It might be fun to incorporate them in a future version
